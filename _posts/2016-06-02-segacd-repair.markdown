title:  "Repaired a Model 1 Sega CD"
categories: sega repair

For the past couple of weeks, I have been working on repairing an old favorite console of mine, the Sega CD. What makes this job special is the fact that it's the first model. This model has a tray-loading mechanism with tons of moving, plastic parts which are notorious for breaking. There are tons of guides on the internet for repairing the console, so I won't bore you with a guide.

I already had a working 'model 1' without a transport (tray) mechanism, so I ordered a complete, albeit broken, console from someone. I took that console and:
-Swapped the power board (blown fuse).
-Swapped the ribbon cable (torn), and placed electrical tape around the RF shielding to prevent more damage.
-Epoxied a plastic hinge which allows the laser assembly to smoothly raise and lower (snapped).
-Epoxied the plastic supports for the transport assembly (three out of four snapped off).
-Applied fresh lithium grease to the laser transport (just because).
-Sprayed De-Oxit contact cleaner in all the open, close, and laser limit switches and waited a day (none were working).
-Replaced all the electrolytic surface mount capacitors on the main board with ceramics of the same rating, to prevent leaking and degradation.

I think that's it! I applied the knowledge I gained from repairing my Sega Game Gear that had leaky capacitors, and also a PC Engine CD briefcase console with a broken CD drive.
