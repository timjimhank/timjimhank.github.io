Welcome to my site! I work in IT, and I am interested in computers, gadgets, electronics and retro gaming. I'll use this site as my place to document things I've done, create how-to guides, as well as just geek out about various topics. Hopefully you'll have as much fun reading my posts as I do writing them!
